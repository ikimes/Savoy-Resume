# Savoy-Resume
  This was a group project where we were tasked with creating a portfolio site for our teacher. This is our codebase for the project.
## Getting Started
  This is a node.js/express app. To get this to run locally: 
  1. Pull this repository
  2. ``npm install``
  3. ``npm start``
  The website is hosted on port 3000, i.e localhost:3000/
